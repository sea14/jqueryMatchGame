    <p>I first ran into the concept of user experience and usability design when I began taking courses in my major.
    I took my first course specifically focused on those topics in fall 2012, called "User Experience Design." I
    knew it was something I really enjoyed, and have continued to take courses with similar subject matter as often
    as I can. Below, you can find several examples of the results of those courses, as well as some of my internship experience, and, most recently, some of the work I've done post-graduation.  They're listed in order
    from the most recent to the oldest.</p>

    <h5>User Experience Designer Role at ITS Web Services, UNC Chapel Hill</h5>

  <p>In January 2014, I began a temporary job as a user experience designer at ITS Web Services, part of the Information Technology Services department at UNC Chapel Hill. So far, in the course of my time in this position, I have done the following:</p>
<ul class="uxPortfolio">
<li>Seeing that there was a lot of content on the site, and wanting to gain an idea of the scope of the site, I created a large content inventory in Microsoft Excel of the current state of <a href="http://its.unc.edu" target="_blank" alt="Information Technology Services, UNC-Chapel Hill">its.unc.edu</a>. The document has over 800 lines.</li>

<li>My manager asked me to benchmark the current site against a set of other university IT sites, including Yale, Stanford, MIT, Stonybrook and Vanderbilt. I listed out some of the most common features I saw between the site homepages - including drop-down navigation, search boxes, carousels, icons and campus IT Status. I also examined how each page referred to material in their top-level nav (i.e, did they use terminology like "Secure Computing," or "Security" to refer to security?" If they didn't have something in the top-level nav that others seemed to, I noted that as well. I was tired of Excel after creating the content inventory, I opted to use Illustrator to create <a href="images/Benchmark-analysis.png" target="_blank" alt="Benchmarking Analysis">this graphic.</a></li>

<li>Most recently, I have been part of weekly meetings that focus on the redesign. I have assisted in the creation of a survey that will be sent out to our users. From there, we will figure out our next steps. I hope to be able to conduct some sort of usability tests, possibly cardsorting.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, in a less user-experience-oriented role at this job, I have also been providing basic WordPress support for University affiliates (such as answering questions on the WordPress support forum) and smaller design projects, such as designing thumbnails for our implmentation of the Pretty Plugins plugin.</p>


    <h5>Grooveshark Usability Evaluation</h5>

    <p>In Fall 2013, I took a course titled "Usability Evaluation and Testing." This course required an overarching group project for the duration of this semester. The group I was part of opted to evaluate the usability of Grooveshark. We took the following steps:</p>
    <ul class = "uxPortfolio">
  <li><p>Our first assignment was to identify our user interface, its users and our ultimate goals for the evaluation. As a group, we settled on Grooveshark. For this assignment, I was in charge of developing the cover page (which would be used on all subsequent assignments for the project) and writing the overview of our rationale for choosing Grooveshark.</p>

    <h5>IBM: User Experience Internship</h5>

    <p name="IBM">In the summer of 2013, I began an internship with IBM in Research Triangle Park in North Carolina. At this internship, I got my first
      real-world taste of UX and design. At first, I just evaluated existing interfaces, then I was given the opportunity to suggest redesigns for
      parts of them. I created mock ups, using Balsamiq, to prototype these redesigns. Finally, I was also given the chance to assist with usability tests
      of new features for the web-based application our work centered around (IBM's Rational Requirements Manager). I really enjoyed creating mock-ups and especially liked conducting and assisting with usability testing. Unfortunately, I cannot share any of the mock-ups I produced for IBM due to confidentiality reasons.</p>

    
    <h5>Piano Picker</h5>

    <a href="Austin.Sharon.SystemDescription718.pdf"><img src="images/pianoPickerLogo.png"></a>
    
    <p>During the spring semester of 2013, I took a course called User Interface Design. In this course, we were charged with
      developing an interface based upon a task we thought was currently difficult. I decided that piano shopping was a difficult task, and then created a series of deliverables that would aid in creating a web-based interface designed for people shopping for pianos. My final project included a final set of wireframes (a prototype) developed in Adobe Illustrator, user personas, design decisions, a task analysis and a system map. You can view the entirety of the final project <a href="Austin.Sharon.SystemDescription718.pdf">here.</a></p>
    
    <h5>Walkin 'N Waggin'</h5><a name="Walkin"</a>
    
    <a href="Austin_FinalProjectAll.pdf"><img src="images/walkinWagginLogo.png"></a>
    
    <p>Our final project for a course called Multimedia Design was to develop a team proposal, an assets inventory, a site map/flow chart, color guide
    and wireframes of several pages belonging to the site we were proposing. I developed the site map and the wireframes using Adobe Illustrator.
    I also included comments about my design decisions and other choices. You can view the entire project by clicking <a href="Austin_FinalProjectAll.pdf">here</a> or clicking the picture above.</p>
    
    <h5>WRAL.com</h5>
    
    <a href="Austin_WRAL_THIS_ONE.pdf"><img src="images/wral_pic.png"></a>
    
    <p>In the Multimedia Design course, we also did usability testing and proposed redesigns for various parts of <a href="http://www.wral.com">WRAL.com's</a> website, a local news station. We split into
    several different teams of four people and developed usability tests for certain parts of the site, then recommended re-designs of pages of our choice on our own. My group
    focused in on the trickier aspects of navigation on the site.
    Although the usability testing was based on the limited population access we had (we assumed the target users would be middle-aged, and, as college students,
    had to rely on the few people we knew above 25 years of age), we did manage to conduct them. 
    The wireframes and design decisions I came up with from the project can be found <a href="Austin_WRAL_THIS_ONE.pdf">here</a>. These wireframes were created using Adobe Illustrator.</p>
    
    <h5>What is Information Science?</h5>
    
    <a href="what_is_info_sci.pdf"><img src="images/Overview+IS+Specializations--SEA_thumbnail.png"></a>
  
  <p>"What is Information Science?" was the overarching project for the first UX/usability course I took, User Experience Design. In this course, each group of students came up with the content inventory, wireframes, user profiles and task analyses for
  an interface of their choosing. The group I worked with opted to create a site for a target audience that consisted of potential students of information science, potential employers of former Information Science students, and
  people involved in the field of Information Science itself. As a group,
  we worked together to create the deliverables required. Each of us was tasked
  with creating one user persona each and a set of wireframes. The user profile I contributed to this project can be found <a href="Persona_UserExperience.pdf">here</a>. You can also see the wireframes I designed for our project using Balsamiq <a href="what_is_info_sci.pdf">here</a>.</p>
